[Annex 2 Section A.2.3.31 Topic 53](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/blob/main/docs/annexes/annex-2/annex-2.02-high-level-requirements-by-topic.md#a2331-topic-53-zero-knowledge-proofs) lists requirements for ZKP. These requirements are not atomic. Herein, ZKP requirements are derived that are atomic and well-formed (with guidance from IEEE 830) from the requirements in Topic 53.

> A ZKP scheme SHALL provide support for the following generic functions, while hiding all attributes of PIDs or attestations: (i) generation of a proof that an (some) attribute(s) having a specific value is (are) included in a PID or attestation, (ii) generation of a proof that a PID or attestation is within its validity period, (iii) generation of a proof that a PID or attestation has not been revoked, and (iv) generation of a proof that a PID or device-bound attestation is bound to a key stored in the WSCA/WSCD or in a keystore of the Wallet Unit. Additionally, a ZKP scheme SHOULD provide support for the following function, which SHOULD be used only when hiding the PID Provider or Attestation Provider is necessary: (v) generation of a proof that a PID or attestation has been issued by a trusted PID Provider or Attestation Provider, without revealing the PID Provider or Attestation Provider. Note: See section 4.1.1 of the Discussion Paper for Topic G. - `ZKP_01`

The following normalized requirements are derived from `ZKP_01`:

| #        | Normalized requirement                                                                                                                                                                              |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ZKP_01.1 | The ZKP scheme SHALL ensure that any generated proof does not enable a verifier or third party to derive information about the credential beyond the explicitly proven statement(s), within the security level defined by the applicable security specification.                                     |
| ZKP_01.2 | The ZKP scheme SHALL support the generation of a proof that one or more specified attributes of a given credential satisfy specified values or predicates, where the attributes and predicates are determined at proof generation time.                                          |
| ZKP_01.3 | The ZKP scheme SHALL support the generation of a proof that a given credential is within its defined validity period at the time of verification.                                                   |
| ZKP_01.4 | The ZKP scheme SHALL support the generation of a proof that a given credential has not been revoked at the time of verification.                                                                    |
| ZKP_01.5 | The ZKP scheme SHALL support the generation of a proof that a device-bound credential is bound to a non-exportable cryptographic key stored in tamper-resistant hardware.                           |
| ZKP_01.6 | The ZKP scheme SHOULD support the generation of a proof that a given credential was issued by a Provider that is a member of a defined trusted set, without revealing the identity of the Provider. |
